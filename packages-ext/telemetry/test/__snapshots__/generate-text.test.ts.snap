Hmm, let's think. There's the atmosphere here. The water vapor and other gases in the atmosphere cause light to be refracted. Wait, right! When sunlight hits the atmosphere, it bends, causing the colors to appear blue. The exact phenomenon is called the dispersion of light or the refraction of light. But how do I explain that without being too technical? Maybe start with the basics. When sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it travels in straight lines, but the air itself causes the light to bend and scatter. This bending, especially with water vapor, makes it seem blue. That should be clear. Also, maybe mention that the specific reason is due to the refraction of light through Earth's atmosphere. Let me check if there's any other factor. Oh, the exact reason is because of the redshift of light, where shorter wavelengths (red) shift to blue. Wait, the sky's color is blue because of this. Oh, right! So the answer should explain that sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere, with water vapor, and the light bends, making the colors appear blue. Need to make sure not to confuse the user with other terms, like the red shift, but simplify. Also, maybe mention that the atmosphere is not the main factor but also other elements like water vapor and gases. That way, the explanation is comprehensive yet understandable.\\n"}]",
