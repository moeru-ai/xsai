Okay, so the user is asking, "Why is the sky blue?" I need to explain why the sky appears blue. I remember from my studies that it's part of the atmosphere's scattering of light. But maybe I should break it down step by step.

First, the basic idea: the Earth's atmosphere contains molecules, mainly nitrogen and oxygen. When light passes through the atmosphere, it interacts with these molecules. The molecules cause the light at different wavelengths to bend. The wavelength that's blue light is shorter than red, so they bend more. This bending effect causes the color we see in the sky to be blue.

Wait, but I should mention the role of water vapor too. Because it also affects how light is scattered. But maybe the main points are the nitrogen and oxygen molecules. Let me check my notes. Yes, it's also true that water vapor contributes to this phenomenon, but it's usually accounted for in the scattering calculations. 

So, putting it all together: the Earth's atmosphere bends blue light more than red, creating a blue sky. Maybe mention that this is why the sun rises and sets reddish at certain times, which is a common question. Also, note that the blue color is a secondary effect in different conditions, like during sunrises or moons. But that's probably too detailed. The key is to explain the scattering of light and the result it has.

The sky appears blue because **light from the sun is scattered by water vapor in the atmosphere**. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Light interacts with the Earthâ€™s atmosphere**â€”specifically, water vapor.
2. **Water vapor causes the light** to **scatter** wavelengths of light. When light from the sun hits water vapor molecules, the shorter wavelengths (like blue light) bend more than longer ones (like red light).
3. **The scattering effect** causes the sky to appear blue: the scattered blue light is what we see as the sky's color.  

This scattered light is a secondary effect caused by water vapor, but the main reason is the atmospheric scattering of blue light. ðŸŒ„âœ¨"
