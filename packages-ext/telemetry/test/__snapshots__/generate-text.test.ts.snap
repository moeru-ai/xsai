"The phenomenon of observing or feeling the blue color of the sky can be attributed to Rayleigh scattering. This occurs when sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere, where it collides with water molecules in the gas layers. These particles scatter the light energy in all directions as shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are more easily scattered than longer wavelengths like red.

The most significant factors that affect this phenomenon include:

1. Atmospheric composition: The presence of gases such as nitrogenand oxygen is crucial.
2. Irradiance: How much sunlight enters the atmosphere directly can also influence scattering.
3. Temperature and angle: These variables help determine how strongly particles scatter light, with higher temperatures generally causing more scattering.

Overall, these factors lead to the blue color we observe in our sky each day."
