Okay, so the user is asking, "Why is the sky blue?" I need to explain why the sky appears blue. I remember that in physics, there's atmospheric dispersion of light, but I need to explain it clearly. Let me start by recalling the basic concept. The Earth's atmosphere causes light to散射. But then I should mention Rayleigh scattering. Oh right, Rayleigh scattering is why the sky is blue. It works inversely, right? So blue color occurs because blue light is scattered more than red light.

Wait, but I should make sure to differentiate between Rayleigh and Mie scattering, maybe? Also, maybe mention that it's not just the sky, like clouds. But the user is asking about the sky, so that's important. Let me structure the answer step by step. Start with the main concept of scattering light, then explain Rayleigh dispersion in detail, maybe mention how different wavelengths get scattered. Also, compare it to the sun's color. Need to keep the explanation simple and avoid jargon. Oh, and finally conclude with the fact that the blue appears after all the visible light, but the user's question is why, so the answer should include that the scattered light forms the blue we see. Alright, that should cover it.

The sky appears blue because of **Rayleigh scattering**, which describes how light interacts with air particles (like Earth's atmosphere). Here's a breakdown:

1. **Rayleigh scattering** explains that:
   - Shorter wavelengths of light (like blue) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (like red).
   - These scattered blue light rays form the blue color we perceive in the sky.

2. **Sunlight's role**:
   - Blue light is scattered at larger angles, while red light is scattered at smaller angles.
   - This scattering leads to the **blue appearance of the sky**.

3. **Comparison**:
   - While blue light is scattered in the sky, the **full spectrum of sunlight** (including red) travels through the atmosphere, contributing to the visible color.

This scattering process makes the sky appear blue despite the sun's reddish hue."
