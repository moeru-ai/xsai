## Packages

xsAI splits different features into different packages.

You can either choose to install a sub-package or an integrated package,
which contains all the basic tools.

```package-install
npm i xsai
```

[Try install with pkg-size.dev](https://pkg-size.dev/xsai)

Update the import of the sub-package to an integrated package:

```diff
- import { generateText } from '@xsai/generate-text'
+ import { generateText } from 'xsai'
```
