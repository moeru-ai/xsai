## Why use the xsAI?

xsAI has a similar interface to the Vercel AI SDK, but is significantly smaller.

This makes it ideal for a variety of scenarios that require smaller bundle size, such as web applications, cli running through npx, and so on.

### So how small is xsAI?

Without further ado, let's look at the results from https://pkg-size.dev:

<PkgSizeChart data={[
  { bundled: 15, gzipped: 5.4, installed: 80, name: 'xsai@0.1.0-beta.6' },
  { bundled: 158, gzipped: 42, installed: 9424, name: 'ai@4.1.45' },
]} />

xsAI reduces the installation size 100x and the bundle size 10x.

And it could be smaller!

If you only need basic text generation, you can just install the `@xsai/generate-text` package:

<PkgSizeChart data={[
  { bundled: 2.7, gzipped: 1.3, installed: 18, name: '@xsai/generate-text@0.1.0-beta.6' },
  { bundled: 15, gzipped: 5.4, installed: 80, name: 'xsai@0.1.0-beta.6' },
]} />
